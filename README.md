# software-design-architecture

- It's important to note that this specialization primarily covers software design and not user-interface design. Although the two aspects of design are closely related, we will mostly focus on software design. We have tried to align our course with the [ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Curriculum Guidelines](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations). It recommends the topics when teaching software design and architecture. However, with that being said, this specialization has no affiliation with ACM or IEEE.
